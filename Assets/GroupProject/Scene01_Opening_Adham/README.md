# Opening corridor — Adham

Open `Scenes/Scene01_Opening_Adham.unity`. All authored environment content belongs to `Scene01_Opening_Adham` in the Hierarchy. The separate `Shared_XR_Player` uses the existing Starter Assets controller rig. The parent is organizational, not an edit lock: agree scene ownership with teammates.

## Prototype behavior
- Three-second black fade when the scene starts, followed by overhead synthesized English welcome audio.
- Cyan floor guidance toward a closed elevator; dim corridor sides.
- Left wall movement instructions and right wall welcome transcript.
- Existing controller locomotion, with move speed reduced to 1.4 m/s.
- Elevator call panel is visual only. Door opening, entry, floor travel, and next-scene handoff are intentionally deferred.

The fade currently begins on scene start, not on detecting headset wear. Restart Play Mode to replay it. The welcome WAV is a replaceable macOS Daniel synthesized prototype, pitched down on its AudioSource.

## Group integration
Use Unity 6000.6.0f1 consistently. Commit Assets and their .meta files together. Keep imported vendor assets unchanged. Assign each teammate a scene to avoid simultaneous scene YAML edits. Use 1 Unity unit = 1 metre, Y up, +Z forward. Keep one shared XR rig and one AudioListener when composing scenes; remove/disable duplicate rigs during integration. This scene is not automatically added to the group's build list.

## Editing
Adjust lighting, panel positions, and guidance directly in the saved scene. OpeningSequence exposes fade duration, camera, audio, and fade material. Tools > Adham > Build Opening Scene creates the scene only if absent; it never overwrites an existing scene. Tools > Adham > Capture Opening Preview renders an editor-only image into Temp/OpeningReview.

## Device acceptance still required
Test Quest standalone and Windows PC Link separately: tracking, controller movement/snap turn, collisions, stereo fade coverage, text readability, overhead audio, and frame timing. Mac editor rendering does not establish device compatibility or performance. Existing OpenXR project settings are preserved.
